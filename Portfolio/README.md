# build-a-portfolio-site
Project #1 for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

May 2018

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
_______________________________________________________________

For this project, I built a portfolio website. There was provided a design
mockup as a PDF-file, and you must replicate that design in HTML and CSS.
It should be a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and
links to each of the portfolio projects completed through the course.
